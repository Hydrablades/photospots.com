# photospots.com
A website about photospots all over the world from and for photographers.

The goal of this website is, to achieve a well structured and easy-to-use photo-spot-finding website.
At the moment it's just a project that came out of frustration, that there are such websites, but
they're often not that well structured, as I would want them to be (oh and I needed a project for the
summer break, but that's incidental).

That's the reason why I it possible, that the development is sometimes stuck for a few days or even weeks.
